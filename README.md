Server Requirements:
Currently uses Apache2 and MariaDB with PHP, HTML, and CSS.  No PHP framework is used.  Installation for the tables is controled by the PHP files.  When attempting to modify a table, it first checks if the table exists, if it does not, it creates it.  The only thing needed is PHP, Apache, and a database in MySQL/MariaDB.
